# DCS-BIOS-cpe

Fork of DCS-BIOS, with some additionals and tweaks.

First release and so far I've added the definitions created by pdmarsh on the DCS forum that
adds support for AJS-37, SA342M, SA342L, SA342Mistral and SpitfireLFMkIX.

I'll focus further improvements on the AJS-37 since that is the module I'm building for myself.
The credit for the improvements go to pdmarsh that has made an amazing piece of work to continiue on. Thanks!
